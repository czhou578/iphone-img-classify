# Iphone Image Classifier

This is a full stack web application that utilizes AI to classify a group of images, and then takes in user prompts to find and retrieve images that fit a certain specified parameter. It is using the PyTorch
Resnet101 pretrained model to train images that were stored on my iPhone. It is also using the Python NLTK library to use natural language processing techniques to identify and extract the keywords that users
type into their prompt, which will then be used to find matching images. 

The frontend is using Tailwind CSS and Next.js.
